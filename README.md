# Pentagrom - Visualizing all musical notes in an isomorphic, unequivocally, orderly and simple way, which exactly match the way notes are represented in a stave  


__Pentagrom__ and __Sistema Solfeo XXI__ was invented by Jaime Iglesias ([Linkedin](https://es.linkedin.com/in/jaimeiglesias/ "Linkedin Jaime Iglesias √Ålvaro-Gracia") and [Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/ES2324268B2/en?assignee=jaime+iglesias&oq=jaime+iglesias)).  

The PENTAGROM project was created using the new SISTEMA SOLFEO XXI musical theory and notation system based on an array of  
```[(7 rows x constant) x 3 columns] + key signature```

You can add as many arrays (or parts thereof) as one wishes in order to increase the range to be able to represent any written note. 
This system also merges the two major theory systems, the "Traditional system" (Europe) and the "Movable Do system" (i.e. Berklee College of Music) helping anybody to visualize univocally any written note as in a stave, no matter the instrument.  
  
Nowadays AI is mature enough for bringing models that might allow exploring the whole potential of this system which, hopefully, could improve the ML algorithims and the way people understand and visualizes music.  

We would like to open source a model using this system and potentially create a visualizing tool for everybody.  

**We have been granted with some funds and a lot of help from [Algovera.ai](https://app.algovera.ai/), we are creating a team and talking about it here:**

- 7 rows: corresponding to notes of the major scale.  
- constant: representing the number of octaves.  
- 3 columns: the central column contains the notes of the key
signature scale, while the side columns refer to the notes which are
half a tone up and down (normally sharps and flats).  
- Key signature: Enables one to tune the instrument in any key. The
musician can also add more key signatures in addition to the 14
existing ones. Thus giving rise to new music.
