# Pentagrom - A unique visual representation in a 3x7 matrix of any written musical note

Pentagrom project was born around 2008 as a patented music controller for education purposes, invented by Jaime Iglesias.
Nowadays AI is mature enough for bringing models that might allow to explore the whole potential, so we want to have an open source model which hopefully bring a better music education and comprehension.
